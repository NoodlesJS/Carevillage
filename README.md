# Carevillage

  It is easy to pile up on medicines you need to take and forget what you may have taken previously. Hence I built carevillage to keep track of all your medicine.

## Development Process

I always start of by jolting down ideas to develop. Once I have a few ideas, I will select the one that interests me and I can find real case use for.
Next I move onto sketching down application features and design. Once I have an idea of how I want the application to look, I move onto ***Figma*** to design the UI for my application. I design both mobile and desktop versions.
After my design goes through different iterations and is complete, I move onto development and spend the next few weeks, developing and pulling my hair out fixing bugs :P

*Below is the final UI design I had finished.*
