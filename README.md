Carevillage is a fullstack and TDD (test driven development) application using ***vanilla javascript*** for client side and ***node.js*** for server side.

It helps users keep track of their medicines.

-  ***Json Web Token*** for securing protected endpoints

-  ***MOCHA and CHAI*** for testing various endpoints


## Development Process

  I initially brainstorm and note down any ideas I come up with. Next I quickly think the ideas through and try to get a feel for what the development would be like. Once I have gone through the ideas, I select one based on combinations of interest, real-world need, technical challenges etc.
  
Once I have selected an idea to develop, i start sketching out design plans and rough wireframes of how everything would work. Afterwards when I have a basic design idea, I move onto ***FIGMA*** to design the UI for my application. In our current technology space, there is no excuse to not have a responsive design that will fit all screens ranging from Desktop to Mobile. So I always make sure to design my UI based on that which immensely helps the development.

After various design iterations,  I move onto my code editor and begin development. I spend the next few weeks developing the frontend and backend of my application and sometimes wanting to pull my hair out trying to fix bugs :p

All in all, I love the whole process from beginning to end. It is an absolute joy :D
