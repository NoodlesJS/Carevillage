# Carevillage

  It is easy to pile up on medicines you need to take and forget what you may have taken previously. Hence I built carevillage to keep track of all your medicine.

## Development Process

Once I have brainstormed an idea, I jolt down features and such on paper and start sketching out a rough design. When I have an idea of how I want the application to look and feel, I move onto ***Figma*** to design the UI for my application. I always make sure my applications are responsive and so I design for both mobile and desktop.
After my design goes through different iterations and is complete, I move onto development and spend the next few weeks, developing and pulling my hair out fixing bugs :P

***Below is the final UI design***
